Set Up
======

First, I went to GitHub to create a new public repo named p8105\_hw1\_yw3236.

Second, I created a local R project named p8105\_hw1\_yw3236 by using File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control and providing the repo URL.

Third, I created a .Rmd file named p8105\_hw1\_yw3236 by using File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown File.

Forth, I used `output: github_document` to render a .Rmd file to a .md file.
