Set Up
======

First, I went to GitHub to create a new public repo named p8105\_hw1.

Second, I created a local R project named p8105\_hw1 by using File &gt; New Project &gt; Version Control and providing the repo URL.

Third, I created a .Rmd file named p8105\_hw1\_yw3236 by using File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown File.

Forth, I used `output: github_document` to render a .Rmd file to a .md file.

Problem 1
=========

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution
-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
-   A (length-10) character vector
-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
set.seed(1)

df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  vec_logical = c(vec_numeric > 2),
  vec_char = c("I", "love", "data", "science", "very", "much", "it", "is", "so", "wonderful"),
  vec_factor = c("yes", "yes", "yes", "no", "no", "no", "yes", "yes", "no", "no")
)
```
