# Set Up

First, I went to GitHub to create a new public repo named p8105_hw1_yw3236.

Second, I created a local R project named p8105_hw1_yw3236 by using File > New Project > Version Control and providing the repo URL.

Third, I created a .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_yw3236 by using File > New File > R Markdown File.

Forth, I used `output: github_document` to render a .Rmd file to a .md file.
